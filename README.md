## Description
As a final project at Concordia Web Development Bootcamp, I chose to create a flashcard app to not only reinforce the material learned throughout the program, but to also create a practical app that helps me in my on-going learning and coding journey.

Shufflr is an MVP made in a two weeks, using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Auth0 was used for user authentications.

## Key Features
1. Create Collections & Cards about any subject in a questions and answers format
2. Study by reviewing the questions side of the cards and flipping them to see the answers
3. Reveal hints to help make the learning process easier
4. Quiz yourself by going into focus mode to receive each card from a collection in a randomized order
5. Organization is key, use the search bar, expandable folder tree, and cards filters to quickly navigate to the important cards

## Cards
See 'All Cards' or the Cards from a specific collection. Here, the cards are displayed Question-side-up, with a hint that can be revealed - the perfect place to study. The bookmark icon allows you to mark a card for 'Review' to quickly identify which ones need more attention. Navigating Cards is easy with the 'Collections', 'Category', and Review filers.

## Folder Navbar
Providing alternative ways to study was important to make Shufflr easy and convenient to use. The expandable side-bar provides collapsable folders of each Collection and its containing cards. Hovering over a question reveals the answers.
